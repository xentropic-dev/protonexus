# ProtoNexus

**ProtoNexus** is a modern, cloud-native industrial data broker built for
flexibility, speed, and simplicity. It bridges industrial systems like PLCs,
SCADA, and IoT devices using a powerful transformation pipeline. Designed with
a container-friendly architecture and written in Zig, ProtoNexus is lightweight
and secure.

The web-based frontend (built with Vite and React) provides a drag-and-drop
interface for creating data flows. Transform modules can be chained,
configured visually, or enhanced with custom scripting. ProtoNexus supports
real-time processing and protocol adapters like OPC UA, MQTT, Modbus, and more.

The backend serves both the API and the frontend static files, making
deployment seamless. You can run ProtoNexus locally with minimal dependencies
or containerize it for production environments. ProtoNexus is the
next-generation alternative to bulky, expensive industrial data brokers. Start
